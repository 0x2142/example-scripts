# Simple Discord Chatbot

This repo contains example code for creating a Discord chatbot. The bot has the ability to query OpenWeatherMap.org APIs and return the current weather conditions. 

This example leverages the [DiscordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) module to quickly & easily build a Discord bot. 

To use this code:
- Set your Discord bot API key as an environment variable: `export BOT_TOKEN=<apikey>`
 - Set your OpenWeather API key: `export OPENWEATHER_TOKEN=<apikey>`
- Run `go run main.go`
- Add bot to a discord server & chat with your bot!

Where to get API keys:
 - [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) 
 - [Discord](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
